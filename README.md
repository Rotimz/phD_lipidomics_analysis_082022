PhD Lipidomics Bioinformatics work on Mass Spec Data

Title: Understandind the Mechannisms of Epidermal Damage and Repair Using 3D Skin Equivalent Models

Description: My PhD project looks to characterise and validate ther use of human-skin equivalent models as viable alternatives to animal testing for pre-clinical drug development. The main aim of the work will be to study how healthy and diseased versions of an inducible-shRNA knockdwon model compare to patient skin samples. Methods of analysis include lipiodmics (mass spec), MSD, immunofluorescence and biophysical characterisation assays such as TEER, TEWL and AFM/nanoindentation.
